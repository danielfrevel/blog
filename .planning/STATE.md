# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-28)

**Core value:** Visual distinction through subtle, mathematically-driven interactivity
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Interactive Background (verification)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Interactive Background)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: All plans complete, awaiting verification
Last activity: 2026-01-29 — Completed 02-03-PLAN.md (Visual Verification)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 2.1 min
- Total execution time: 0.21 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 6.3min | 2.1min |
| 02 | 3 | 8.2min | 2.7min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (2min), 02-01 (1.7min), 02-02 (1.5min), 02-03 (5min)
- Trend: Verification plans take longer due to iteration

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Light default theme confirmed (user preference for minimal/clean aesthetic)
- Knowledge graph deferred to v2 (needs Cosma investigation or content corpus)
- 65ch max-width for prose content (optimal line length 50-75 chars) [01-01]
- Flexbox sticky footer over absolute positioning [01-01]
- CSS clamp() for fluid font sizes over breakpoint-based sizing [01-01]
- Variable fonts reduce HTTP requests (one file vs multiple weights) [01-02]
- System dark mode preference honored for new visitors [01-02]
- Manual visual verification necessary for layout and typography quality [01-03]
- All Phase 1 success criteria confirmed through user testing [01-03]
- Use simplex3 (not simplex2) for time-evolving flow field patterns [02-01]
- Distance squared check before sqrt for mouse force calculation (performance) [02-01]
- Edge wrapping not clamping for seamless particle flow [02-01]
- Responsive particle count: 50% on mobile viewports [02-01]
- Use pointer:coarse media query for mobile detection (not viewport width) [02-02]
- Static gradient (not blank background) for reduced-motion fallback [02-02]
- 100ms debounce on resize handler to avoid excessive redraws [02-02]
- 80 particles desktop / 40 mobile (reduced for cleaner look) [02-03]
- Faster trail fade (0.15) for less visual clutter [02-03]
- Elevated card design for content area (solid bg, rounded, shadow) [02-03]
- Particle respawn mechanism prevents convergence clustering [02-03]
