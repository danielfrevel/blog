<objective>
Verify the interactive background animation meets all requirements through visual testing in the browser.

Purpose: Confirm the animation achieves "noticeable but calm" aesthetic and all technical requirements (BG-01 through BG-05) work correctly before marking the phase complete.

Output: User confirmation that animation is ready, or feedback for adjustments.

  <what-built>
Interactive background animation with:
- Simplex noise flow field driving particle movement
- Mouse repulsion effect
- Page Visibility API (pauses when tab hidden)
- prefers-reduced-motion static gradient fallback
- Mobile adaptive particle count
- High-DPI canvas rendering
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the Hugo dev server and verify each requirement:

**BG-01: Flow field renders behind content**
1. Run `hugo server -D` and open http://localhost:1313
2. Confirm canvas is visible behind page content
3. Verify text is fully readable over animation
4. Check animation on both home page and a blog post

**BG-02: Particles react to mouse**
1. Move mouse around the page
2. Particles should repel away from cursor
3. Effect should be noticeable but not jarring

**BG-03: Respects prefers-reduced-motion**
1. Enable "Reduce motion" in system settings:
   - macOS: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion
   - Windows: Settings > Ease of Access > Display > Show animations OFF
   - Linux: Desktop-dependent or use browser DevTools
2. Refresh page
3. Should see subtle static gradient instead of animation
4. Disable setting, refresh - animation should return

**BG-04: Performance check**
1. Open DevTools Performance tab
2. Record ~5 seconds of animation
3. Check for consistent frame rate (targeting 60fps desktop)
4. On mobile (or DevTools mobile emulation), verify fewer particles render

**BG-05: Tab visibility**
1. Switch to another browser tab
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Switch back
4. Animation should have been paused (not advanced while hidden)
5. Optional: Add console.log in stopAnimation/startAnimation to confirm

**Visual quality check:**
- Is the animation "noticeable but calm"?
- Does it draw the eye briefly without being distracting?
- Does it fit the minimal aesthetic from Phase 1?
- Are colors appropriate for both light and dark modes?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all requirements pass, or describe what needs adjustment:
- If particles too subtle/bold: suggest density or alpha changes
- If movement too fast/slow: suggest speed adjustments
- If colors don't fit: suggest color changes
- If performance issues: describe the problem
  </resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
- User confirms "approved" after testing all requirements
- OR user provides specific feedback that gets addressed in a follow-up plan
</success_criteria>
