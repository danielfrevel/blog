    - "Typography scales smoothly when resizing window"

<objective>
Verify all layout and typography changes work correctly together through visual testing.

Purpose: Automated tests can't verify visual layout, readability, and smooth scaling. Human verification ensures the phase goal is achieved: "Content is readable and professionally structured."

Output: Confirmation that all Phase 1 success criteria are met.

Run `npm run dev` to start the Hugo development server.

Note the URL (typically http://localhost:1313).

Prepare a test blog post URL if available, or use the home page for initial verification.

  <what-built>
Complete layout and typography foundation:
- Optimal line length (65ch/~50-75 chars) via Tailwind typography
- Sticky footer via flexbox pattern
- Variable font loading (Inter 100-900 weight range)
- Light default theme with functional dark mode toggle
- Fluid typography utilities available
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Open http://localhost:1313 in browser**

1. **Line Length (LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-03)**
   - Navigate to a blog post with paragraphs of text
   - Count characters in a typical line (should be 50-75)
   - Content should be narrower than header, centered

2. **Sticky Footer (LAYOUT-02)**
   - Visit a short content page (e.g., /about/ or home with few posts)
   - Footer should touch viewport bottom
   - Scroll if content is long - footer should be below content

3. **Variable Font (LAYOUT-04)**
   - Open DevTools > Network > filter "font"
   - Should see one Inter font file (not 4 separate weights)
   - Text should render with proper font weights

4. **Light Default (LAYOUT-05)**
   - Open incognito/private window
   - Site should display LIGHT theme
   - Click dark mode toggle - should switch to dark
   - Refresh - should stay dark (localStorage persists)
   - Toggle back to light, refresh - should stay light

5. **Fluid Typography (LAYOUT-06) - Optional Check**
   - Resize browser window from mobile to desktop width
   - If fluid classes are applied to headings, they should scale smoothly
   - (Note: fluid utilities are available but may not be applied to all elements yet)

6. **Mobile Check**
   - Set viewport to mobile width (375px)
   - No horizontal scroll
   - Content readable, footer still at bottom
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe specific issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All Phase 1 success criteria verified:
1. Content has optimal line length (50-75 chars desktop) without horizontal scroll on mobile
2. Footer stays at viewport bottom when content is short
3. Typography scales smoothly across viewport sizes with variable font loading
4. Light theme displays by default with functional dark mode toggle
</verification>

- User confirms footer at viewport bottom on short pages
- User confirms light theme default in incognito
- User confirms dark mode toggle works
- User confirms no mobile horizontal scroll
- No visual regressions from previous state
</success_criteria>
