**Defined:** 2026-01-29
**Core Value:** Visual distinction through subtle, mathematically-driven interactivity

## v1 Requirements

### Layout & Typography (LAYOUT)

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: Content uses optimal line length (50-75 chars on desktop)
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: Footer stays at bottom when content is short (sticky footer)
- [x] **LAYOUT-03**: Content area has proper max-width and centering
- [x] **LAYOUT-04**: Typography uses variable font for performance
- [x] **LAYOUT-05**: Light theme is default, dark mode toggle available
- [x] **LAYOUT-06**: Fluid typography scales with viewport

### Interactive Background (BG)

- [ ] **BG-01**: Perlin noise flow field renders on canvas behind content
- [ ] **BG-02**: Particles react to mouse movement
- [ ] **BG-03**: Animation respects prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] **BG-04**: Performance stays smooth (60fps on desktop, 30fps minimum on mobile)
- [ ] **BG-05**: Animation pauses when tab is not visible (battery optimization)

### Comments (COMM)

- [ ] **COMM-01**: Isso comment system deployed alongside blog
- [ ] **COMM-02**: Guests can comment without authentication
- [ ] **COMM-03**: Comments display below blog posts
- [ ] **COMM-04**: Spam protection via honeypot field
- [ ] **COMM-05**: Rate limiting prevents abuse

### View Transitions (VT)

- [ ] **VT-01**: Page transitions use View Transition API
- [ ] **VT-02**: Transitions feel smooth and intentional
- [ ] **VT-03**: Fallback for browsers without support (no broken experience)

## v2 Requirements

### Knowledge Graph

- **GRAPH-01**: Interactive graph showing post connections
- **GRAPH-02**: Nodes represent posts, edges represent shared tags or explicit links
- **GRAPH-03**: Graph is navigable (click node to go to post)

*Deferred because: Need Cosma integration investigation or substantial content corpus first*

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User authentication for comments | Complexity not worth it for personal blog |
| Real-time features (websockets) | Static site philosophy |
| CMS/admin interface | Markdown + git is the workflow |
| Analytics/tracking | Privacy-focused |
| Social share buttons | Tracking concerns, clutter |
| Heavy JS frameworks | Contradicts minimal aesthetic, bundle bloat |
| Autoplay anything | UX nightmare |
